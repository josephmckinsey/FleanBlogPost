# FleanBlogPost

1. Generate the post with 

```bash
lake exe generate-post
```

2. Copy over the flean files to the flean folder (or another static folder) in pelican.

Right now, the "flean" directory is hard-coded in the highlighting and JS scripts. I didn't
want to spend the time threading configuration, partly because it seems really annoying
to go from the docs command on the Post.lean page elsewhere.

3. Copy over the index.html to flean2.html
